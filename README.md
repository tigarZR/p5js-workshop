Welcome to the p5.js in Typescript Workshop
===========================================

I used the code scaffold outlined by [p5ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p5ts), "a Node Package Execution that generates a Typescript implementation of the popular visual graphics library [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) which is usually written in Javascript."

In this workshop, you'll be learning how to use p5.js to create interactive art, games, or just some pretty shapes on the screen. 

Getting Started
